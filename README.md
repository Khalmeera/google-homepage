This project took me around 2 days to finish, I learned the basics of HTML as well as CSS. I learned a lot from simply trying to deconstruct existing web pages and trying to recreate them using my own code. It helped me understand the concepts of Flex Boxes, Margins, and positioning very well. Overall, this project has made me a lot more confident when it comes to using HTML and CSS together. I cannot wait to learn more from The Odin Project. Please leave your feedback if you ever come across this in the future. Thank you for reading this.
